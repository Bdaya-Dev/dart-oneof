# Enabled GitHub actions - https://docs.github.com/actions
# If you have no configuration, you can set the value to `true` or just leave it
# empty.
github:
  # Specify the `on` key to configure triggering events.
  # See https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on

        - main
    pull_request:
      branches:

  # Setting just `cron` is a shortcut to keep the defaults for `push` and
  # `pull_request` while adding a single `schedule` entry.
  # `on` and `cron` cannot both be set.

  # You can group stages into individual workflows  
  #
  # Any stages that are omitted here are put in a default workflow
